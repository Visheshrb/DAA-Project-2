#Experimental vs Theoretical Complexity Analysis
This repository contains a Python program that compares the experimental runtime with its theoretical time complexity, O(n log(n))

#Description
The function simulates an algorithm where  we calculate time complexity The program:

Measures experimental runtimes.
Calculates the theoretical complexity values.
Computes a scaling constant by taking the median of the ratio between experimental and theoretical runtimes.
Plots the experimental runtimes against the scaled theoretical values.
Outputs a detailed table showing values used and computed metrics.
How to Run
git clone https://github.com/Visheshrb/DAA-Project-2.git
cd DAA-Project-2
Then run the python program
